C# OpenGl Project 
=================

Introduction
------------

This project has been created to hightlight the use of C# and opengl with openTK. Mostly experimental work in a 3d environment that 'might' lead to some form of a rendering engine.  I had started with an old school project and converted it from opengl1 to opengl3.
